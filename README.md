# Introduction:
Welcome to the pyGCS wiki!

pyGCS is an open source project for multiple quadcopter ground control station mainly written in Python.

Currently, this project is still under construction and the focus point will be successfully running on macOS, iOS systems. But it has the possibility to run on Linux or Windows systems in the future. I am sure I will do it because the start point is to develop a cross-platform ground control station.

# Features already implemented:
    1. Upload missions
    2. Check multiple quadcopter status
    3. Load Google Static Maps
    4. Mouse click on map to create waypoints
    5. iPhone Joystick App for single quadcopter control
    6. iPad GCS App mainly for quadcopter position monitoring
    7. Load missions from file
    8. Save missions to file

# Features to be implemented:
    1. Edit waypoints by dragging points on the map
    2. More features
